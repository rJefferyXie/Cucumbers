                Cucumbers, the end all and be all of our existence. 
                The age old question of whether these succulent treats should be consumed whole or in slices has finally been solved by this doctor from USASK.
                Studies conducted by the world renowned Dr. Cugh Kumber have proven that consuming the cucumber whole can result in reduced motor functions by a factor of up to 400% with a +-400% variance rate depending on the individual.
                His most recent discovery has found that consuming the cucumber in slices will not only avoid the aforementioned downfalls but may also promote muscle growth by 0.00001%.
                These facts have been approved by Cucumber Corp, with Dr. Cugh Kumber at the head of the research project.
                We hope that this news finds you well and that your cucumber consuming experiences can continue to be great!
